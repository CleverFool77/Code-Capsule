## The Solution
* EASE AND SIMPLICITY  
Code Capsule is a coding tool built with the aim of simplifying your brainstorming-coding experience. As the name suggests Code Capsule compresses the various steps involved in coding from scratch, into a simple 3 click process - Scan. Edit. Run.
* CONVENIENCE  
Code capsule works on programming languages to bring your ideas from the chalk board into a reality.Owing to its highly versatile nature, Code Capsule finds applications in multiple domains, ranging from personal use at home, to institutional use by instructors or evaluators.
